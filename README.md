# My first SQL Query Capstone as a Work Experience
## AgeX Shipping  Company Data  Analysis using MySQL for SQL Query as a Capstone given by EvolveHQ Data Analytics Certification Program

# Overview
AgeX Shipping Company is a global logistics firm that began its operations in February 2020.
The company's primary business revolves around shipping packages between the USA, Canada, and Nigeria.
This project analyzed AgeX Shipping Data using the collected data on their customers and shipping orders to provide valuable business insights.

Analytics Tool: MySQL

# Experience Gained
I conducted end-to-end data analysis on 1,000+ customer and shipping records to uncover business insights for a global logistics company operating in the USA, Canada, and Nigeria.
I implemented SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, grouping, and filtering to answer 17 analytics questions, including customer segmentation, sales trends, and route popularity.
I delivered actionable recommendations that highlighted top-spending customers, profitable routes, and customer engagement trends, improving decision-making.

9. Average Shipping Cost: What is the average shipping cost per pound (weight_lbs) for packages from each origin country? <br>

## Part 3: Joins, HAVING, and WHERE Clauses 
Apply your knowledge of joins and advanced filtering to solve these problems.<br>
10. Most Expensive Order: Find the package_id and the final_cost of the most expensive order in the database. <br>
11. High-Value Customers: Find the customer_id and the total amount they have spent for all customers who have spent more than $500 in total. Order the results from the highest spender to the lowest. <br><br>

## Part 4: Wildcards, Aliases, and Concatenation 
These questions require you to use more advanced SQL techniques. <br>
15. Customers with Specific Names: Find all customers whose last name starts with the letter 'O'. <br>
